# Data-Science-For-Starters-Kaggle-Comp
Workings for a course competition on Data science. The goal is to fit and train multiple models on the training dataset, and predict target values on test dataset using the best model.

March 2023

Kaggle competition held at the end of a starters course on Data Science delivered by professionals at my work place "Astera Software".

I came in second after utilizing multiple different regressors and trying to optimize their hyper parameters.

I wanted to try CUDA acceleration for further checks, however the time and resource constraint kept me from doing so.
